# gansim

Make sure you have [go](https://golang.org/doc/install) and [git](https://git-scm.com/) installed.

Then

```
git clone https://github.com/srliao/gansim.git
cd ./gansim
go run main.go
```

By default the graphs will be generated `./graphs` so make sure you create a graphs folder or else this will fail.
