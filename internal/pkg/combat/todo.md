    modify char hp, char stats
- ones that affect the snapshot
    modify snapshot stats, snapshot element

field
- geo constructs
    albedo E
    zhongli E

char.statMods <- coded as action that adds to this and checked every tick
- Bennett ult
    register an action
    on tick:
        check if hp needs to be healed
        remove stat buff from non active char if present
        check if hp > 70, if so, add buff to active char stat buff
- Albedo A4
    register an action
    on register, add buff to all char
    on expiry, remove buff from all char
- Jean Q
